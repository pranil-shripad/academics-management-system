V1.0:
This version has backend working and frontend without Tailwind working, I has a simple and minimal tailwind configuration.
Also the backend is connected to the database.

V2.0:
In this version I have added proper tailwind, and also added shadcn-ui for minimal look.
The login page has black textbox for user email and password due to which the Email and Password is not visible while entering the same, which needs to be fixed.
